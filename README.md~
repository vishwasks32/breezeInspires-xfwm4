# xfwm-theme-breeze
A clone of KDE/Plasma 5's "Breeze" window manager theme. It is designed to go well with the [Breeze GTK theme offered by dirruk1](https://github.com/dirruk1/gnome-breeze).

I got lazy and some of the "pressed" states are missing their own assets. Feel free to fork this and add them.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/psy-q/xfwm-theme-breeze.git ~/.themes/Breeze-xfwm

You can of course call it whatever you like on your local machine.
